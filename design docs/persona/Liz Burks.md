## About

Age: 28

Education: Bachelors degree in English Literature

Experience: Four years working in a book store, then took a coding camp and started taking short contract web work.

Responsibilities: Help small business owners figure out what their sites need and sets them up with Squarespace or Wordpress sites.

Initial touch-point: One of Liz's customers asked her to build an aug for their real estate business.

## Highlights

- Often spends half of her billable time educating her clients
- Has two e-readers but doesn't want to give up her library of paper books

## Goals

- Streamline small business site production so that she can take more jobs
- Attract larger customers who need more specialized services so she can charge more
- At some point have enough time for more of a social life

## Frustrations

- Her current customers don't want to pay for service contracts but get angry when sites go stale
- Clients often come in wanting a feature based on a technical buzzword they read about on-line
- The web (especially Javascript) is changing so quickly that she has trouble keeping up

## User story

Liz has never had a problem working with clients, and that's why her customers are enthusiastic about recommending her to their friends. At a web developer conference she stands out, not just because she's tall and sometimes the only woman of color, but because she's usually the session organizer and knows half of the attendees.

When the book store she managed went out of business in 2009, she decided to switch careers and attend a code camp. When she realized that it wasn't that hard to make squarespace and wordpress web sites, she filed incorporation papers half-way through the course and had clients lined up for the week after she graduated.

Liz spends about half of her time connecting with potential and previous clients over coffee and the other half working from a corner of her living room. She makes time for yoga, but hasn't figured out yet how to date and see friends when she has so many projects in flight.
