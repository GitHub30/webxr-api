Organization: US Army, Fort Benning GA

Quote: "If I can get the parts, I can fix your vehicle. If I can't get the parts, I can probably still fix it."

## About

Age: 34

Education: High school degree, Army mechanical engineering certificate

Experience: Worked on cars with his father growing up and in high school. Went through a two year training program with the Army.

Responsibilities: Work with the maintenance IT systems to track what vehicles need work and arrange with the users to bring in the vehicles. Perform maintenance. When a vehicle fails, determine and document the failure point, order parts, and perform fixes.

Initial touch-point: The PCs in the garage and office run a military version of Windows, but all of the tools run their own embedded systems. The vehicles run a hardened Linux.

## Highlights

- Has many years of working with quirky shop computers and on-board systems.

## Goals

- Avoid negative attention from people of higher rank.
- Hit the target throughput numbers that the IT systems set for his team.
- Keep the vehicles in top condition and ready for deployment.

## Frustrations

- Ancient Windows OS and hardware on the office PCs.
- Each version of the vehicle systems uses incompatible parts and software.

## User story

Frank Morano has seen it all and can no longer be shocked. He's seen humvees towed in behind tanks. He's seen axles sheared while driving on flat roads. People in other bases send Frank descriptions of unusual damage and he no longer raises an eyebrow.

With the exception of the two years that the was being trained as a mechanical engineer, Frank has worked on cars and trucks pretty much every day since he was 9. His father and he restored cars in their garage to earn extra money for the family, and now he manages a base garage where hundreds of vehicles pass through each month.

Most days, Frank rarely sits down long enough to get annoyed at the PC in his office. He's called to the garage floor so often that now he just works from one of the unused stations down there or from his handset. It's regular hours and he has enough free time that he can live off base and live in the nearby town.

Frank has watched as vehicles switched from analog radios to on-board digital navigation and communication systems. They don't necessarily work better, they just have different failure states.
