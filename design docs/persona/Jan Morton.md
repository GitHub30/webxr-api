## User story

Jan has this job buttoned up. She's trained her boss on how to communicate her needs and how to read the email that Jan sends her. 

After Jan's kids were old enough that they didn't need her at home full time, she started working for a new manager at Univoi. Over the last eleven years, both Jan and the manager have moved up through the org chart to the SVP level. Jan now manages several other administrative assistants in the sales division.

Jan thinks of herself as a chaos filter for her boss and for the division as a whole. She spends most of her day managing a large number of ongoing projects using every form of IT that you can imagine. She's never without her handset and tablet, and often she also has her laptop propped on a copy machine or on a counter in the office kitchen so that she can respond to the many requests that land in her in-box every day.

A good day for Jan ends when all of the surprises that come her way have been translated into well managed and scheduled events for her boss and her boss's direct reports.
