## User story

Shane is the young man who always seems to have more than one thing going on. Whether it's running errands for work, or working on homework, he usually has a tablet playing Netflix or Hulu and is messaging friends on his handset. After homework, he's usually editing some of the footage he took during the day into videos that he posts on-line.

He likes when on-line videos have additional information about the actors and the directors so that he can look up more information about their careers and how they think about making videos. He occasionally watches on-line courses about video production and story telling with the idea that he'll get more views and likes when he posts.
