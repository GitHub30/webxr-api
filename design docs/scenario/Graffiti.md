Lee is bored. School is boring. Teachers are boring. The other students are especially boring. Seems like hanging out down by the river is the only time he gets to think and not worry about what's happening at home and hear about stupid crap he doesn't care about. He likes to draw, though. When he gets to the river he puts on the glasses that they issued him at school and pulls out his mobile. He touch taps open the drawing app, picks the brush and color, and then uses the mobile to draw big strokes around the path by the river's bank. He adds fantastic new flowers to tree limbs. He draws a short castle around the snake hole where he saw that long snake that time. He runs across some of his earlier drawings and erases them, because he's a lot better at drawing now.

Lee takes a selfie of himself surrounded by his drawings and sends it to his mother. Maybe it will help her through today. Sometimes he skims other peoples' drawings, but mostly they're boring, so mostly he just makes things prettier than how he found them.
