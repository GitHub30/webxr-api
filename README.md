# webar-api
A proposal and starting point for discussing a WebAR extension to WebVR.

In order to make progress on defining a WebAR extension to WebVR, we are creating a proposal for this capability.  The api is intended to extend either the native WebVR implementation, or the WebVR polyfill, with AR capabilities appropriate for the underlying platform.
