# webar-polyfill
A polyfill for a WebAR extension to WebVR.

In order to make progress on defining a WebAR extension to WebVR, we are creating a polyfill to develop a proposal for this capability.  The polyfill is intended to extend either the native WebVR implementation, or the WebVR polyfill, with AR capabilities appropriate for the underlying platform.
